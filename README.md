# Naming Game Simulator
HO-NG Hearer-Only Naming Game simulator. This project implements the NG simulator of a predefined number of agents communicating and spreading information in a network. 
After some epochs and under specific conditions, several scenarios show up. An opinion can virally spread in exponential time or log linear time or can be completely censored by the network of agents. 


Two agents are created in a Symmetric Agent (producer and consumer) scenario:


  Agent produces words to her neighboors' buffer
	
  Agent consumes words from her local queue
